# Alexander Chaplin Braz's configuration files (mostly)

One of my life goals is to keep my $HOME clean and organized, that mostly means
that when I run `ls -alh` in $HOME everything fits vertially in my terminal.
That's why I chose to go minimal and build my system from the ground up,
avoiding programs that put their junk there without giving any way to change it.

This repository is populated with a script called
[rdot](https://github.com/AlexChaplinBraz/minor-scripts/blob/master/rdot),
which uses rsync to copy a manually selected list of files.
This way I don't have to have .git, .gitignore and README.md
cluttering my $HOME.

UPDATE: I decided to temporarily give up on this because I was spending more
time configuring everything than doing actual work. So I've changed my distro
to Manjaro so that most everything works out of the box and changed from my
Emacs config to Doom Emacs for the same reason. I'm even using other software
like VSCode just to minimize configuring stuff. I do very much enjoy tinkering,
but it had a negative effect on my time. I'll do it all over again once I buy
a new computer, but until then this repo won't be updated.
