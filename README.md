# Alexander Chaplin Braz's configuration files (mostly)

One of my life goals is to keep my $HOME clean and organized, that mostly means
that when I run `ls -alh` in $HOME everything fits vertially in my terminal.
That's why I chose to go minimal and build my system from the ground up,
avoiding programs that put their junk there without giving any way to change it.

This repository is populated with a script called
[rdot](https://github.com/AlexChaplinBraz/minor-scripts/blob/master/rdot),
which uses rsync to copy a manually selected list of files.
This way I don't have to have .git, .gitignore and README.md
cluttering my $HOME.
