# Alexander Chaplin Braz's configuration files (mostly)

One of my life goals is to keep my $HOME clean, so I try to avoid programs
that put their junk in there without giving any way to change it.
That's why I chose to go minimal and build my system from the ground up.

This repository is populated with a script called 
[rdot](https://github.com/AlexChaplinBraz/minor-scripts/blob/master/rdot),
which uses rsync to copy a manually selected list of files.
This way I don't have to have .git, .gitignore and README.md 
cluttering my $HOME.
